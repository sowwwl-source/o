# Netlify Configuration File
# Note: Netlify mainly supports Static Sites. PHP files (index.php, etc.) will NOT execute dynamically on Netlify.
# They will be downloaded as text files unless you use a specific plugin or functions workaround.

# Redirects for clean URLs (simulating .htaccess)
# HYBRID DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION
# 1. Static files (index.html, css, js) are served by Netlify.
# 2. PHP files and routes must be proxied to an external PHP server.
# REPLACE "https://YOUR-BACKEND.com" with your actual PHP server URL (e.g. Heroku app, Railway, VPS).
